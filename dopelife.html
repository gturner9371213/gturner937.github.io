    <div id = dopelifep>Dope Life is a short film/pilot centered around the main character, Derrick Dillard, who was imprisoned in the early 2000s for possession of cocaine with the intent to sell. It begins with his incarceration and follows his subsequent release, showcasing his attempts to adjust to life outside of prison. I portray two characters: Gene, Derrick Dillard's brother, and Vern, the main antagonist in Dope Life. I hope you enjoy it! </div>
