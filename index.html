        <h1> Garrett Turner Personal Site </h1>
        <p>Welcome to my personal website! I'm a graduate student at New Mexico State, working towards a Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science. 
        In my free time, I love to engage in creative art projects, ranging from simple doodles on my laptop to working on independent films. 
        I'm also a big sports fan, especially of my favorite teams, and I enjoy the added excitement of watching games I've placed bets on.</p>

        <p>This site features information and a link to a pilot I worked on called "Dope Life," where I played two characters, Vern and Gene. 
        The site will also feature a animation pilot called Grillbillies where I play a Cooter and a page of my digital art .</p>
